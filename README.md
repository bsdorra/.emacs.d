# My Humble Emacs Config

I recently update to the use of "use-package" for package
dependencies. Default behavior is set to :ensure, so all dependencies
will be downloaded automatically on the first start.

Otherwise, the config is basically a collection of gathered code
fragments from all over the web. Maybe you find something useful, have
fun!

## Dependencies
Some of the used packages depend on external tools
- [irony-mode](https://github.com/Sarcasm/irony-mode): LLVM with clang
- [on-ipython](https://github.com/gregsexton/ob-ipython): IPython/Jupyter, Tornado
- [magit](https://github.com/magit/magit): Git
